   ```

2. **Theme switching fails**:
   - Some themes may not be available on your system
   - Try different themes from the dropdown

3. **Performance seems slow**:
   - Reduce test parameters for faster execution
   - Close other applications to free system resources
   - Check system info for resource availability

4. **Tests won't run**:
   - Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed
   - Verify Tkinter is available
   - Check console for error messages

### Platform-Specific Notes

- **macOS**: Uses 'aqua' theme by default
- **Windows**: May use 'vista' or 'win32' themes
- **Linux**: Typically uses 'clam' or 'alt' themes

## Performance Optimization Tips

### For Better Test Results
1. Close unnecessary applications
2. Run tests multiple times and average results
3. Use consistent test parameters
4. Monitor system resources during testing
